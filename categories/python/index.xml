It&amp;rsquo;s still in production and there are no problems with it. The only exception being that there are planned changes to the database schema. Weighing my options, I decided to move forward with an upgrade to Django 1.10, because migrations are now &amp;ldquo;built-in&amp;rdquo; and data reliability is more important to me than a few extra hours of trouble-shooting the differences between the versions.</description></item></channel></rss>
